Testing and Analysis:

1st Iteration
Time to insert 1000 entries on server = 479843
Time to insert one entry on server = 479843/1000 = 479 milisecond


2nd Iteration
Time to insert 1000 entries on server = 332759 miliseconds
Time to insert one entry on server = 332759/1000 = 332.75 miliseconds

3rd iteration
Time to insert 1000 entries on server = 479586
Time to insert one entry on server = 479586/1000 = 479.59 miliseconds

Insertion time is higher to reduce the search time

//4881 rows in Obj_Table and 48,348 in KeyValue Table
For search of 10,000 items, time taken = 8.734215
average time for search=8.734215/10000 = 0.873 milliseconds

2nd iteration:
Time = 8.176388

3rd iteration:
Time = 8.371741

//significantly low

Time to subscribe a channel by 10,000 clients = 1.509632 seconds = 1509.63 miliseconds
Time to subscribe a channel by 1 client = 1509.63/10000 miliseconds =.15 miliseconds

Time to publish 10,000 msgs to 500 subscribers:
Starting Time : 15:00:59
End Time : 15:02:51
number of messages per second = 10000*500/2*60+52 = 10000*500/132 = 37,878

2nd Iteration:
Starting Time : 15:25:38
End Time : 15:27:28

number of msgs per second = 10000*500/110 = 45,454

3rd iteration
Strat Time :15:30:42
End Time : 15:32:32

number of msgs per second = 10000*500/120 = 41,666
